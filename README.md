# Billor Coding Challenge: Driver Mobile App

## Objective

Develop a mobile application using React Native that functions as driver app. The app should enable user authentication, display and manage loads, capture and send document images, facilitate real-time chat communication, and provide push notifications, while also allowing users to manage their profile.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement a login screen with form validation.
   - Integrate with an authentication API (e.g., Firebase Auth or a custom API).

2. **Loads Management:**
   - Display a list of loads with filtering and search capabilities.
   - Provide a detailed view for each load, including additional information, map and relevant actions.

3. **Documents Integration:**
   - Use the device camera to capture and submit document images associated with loads.

4. **Real-Time Chat:**
   - Develop a real-time messaging system for communication between support agents and users.
   - Maintain a conversation history for ongoing chats.

5. **Push Notifications:**
   - Integrate push notifications (e.g., via Firebase Cloud Messaging) to alert users about important updates.
   - Handle notifications appropriately when the app is active, in the background, or closed.

6. **User Profile Management:**
   - Provide a profile screen where users can update personal information and app settings.

## Technical Requirements

- **Technologies:**
  - **React Native** with React Navigation for routing.
  - State management using Context API or Redux.
  - Integration with native device capabilities (camera, push notifications).
  - External APIs for authentication, chat, and notifications.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Write clean, modularized, and reusable code.
  - Ensure responsiveness and compatibility across iOS and Android platforms.
  - Handle asynchronous operations, loading states, and error management gracefully.
  - (Optional) Include unit tests for critical functionalities.

- **Data:**
  - Simulate or integrate with APIs for load management, chat, and authentication.
  - Use mocks or public APIs where appropriate.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Does the app meet the functional requirements (authentication, loads management, camera integration, chat, notifications, profile management)?
- **Code Quality:** Is the project well-organized and does the code adhere to best practices?
- **Use of Technologies:** Does the candidate demonstrate proficiency in React Native, state management, and native device integration?
- **User Experience:** Is the application intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly?
- **Problem-Solving:** How effectively are asynchronous operations, error management, and cross-platform compatibility handled?

## Submission

- Host your source code on a public repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Provide clear instructions on how to run the project.
- (Optional) Include documentation explaining your technical decisions.

Good luck!
